A complete documentation of the software written by Andreas Albisser for the Teensy 3.1 can be found in \ref{arduino software analysis}.\\
Various issues found with his software can be found in \ref{Teensy 3.1 software problems}.\\
Now there are two options on how to proceed
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port the existing software to C with FreeRTOS.
    \item Create a new software concept and implement it.
\end{itemize}
Both options are evaluated below.\\

Talk about new SW concept

\subsubsection{To-Do List for new SW}%
%
Talk about the things that have not yet been implemented, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Package numbering instead of waiting for ACK
    \item Limit throughput
    \item No sending out the same package over multiple connections at the same time and only taking the one that was received first.
    \item Delay until package is dismissed -> this parameter is defined by timeout and maximum number of retries per connection anyway
\end{itemize}
