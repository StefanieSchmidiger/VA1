This project is demonstrating using printf() on the FRDM-KL25Z board, without Processor Expert.

COM port settings:
- UART0, PTA1 and PTA2: this is connected to OpenSDA USB CDC
- 38400 baud

If you do not use floating point variables for printf()/scanf(), then the 'INT' version of the libraries can be used.
Otherwise you need the 'FP' version of the libraries.
