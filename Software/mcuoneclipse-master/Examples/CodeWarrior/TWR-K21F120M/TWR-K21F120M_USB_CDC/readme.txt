----------
Demo project for USB CDC on the TWR-K21F120M board from Freescale.
The application uses 4 LED's for status (enumerated or not).
Once enumerated, it echoes the characters on the connected terminal.

- Power the Board through the OpenSDA USB port
- Connect the board to the host with the K21 USB port (on the TWR board)
- Use a terminal program to connect to the board (e.g. Termite with 38400 baud)
- Type in some text :-)
