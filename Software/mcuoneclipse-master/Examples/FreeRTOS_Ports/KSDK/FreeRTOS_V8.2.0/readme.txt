Kinetis SDK can work with different RTOS through OS Abstraction layer. This folder is reserved for “FreeRTOS” kernel. The “FreeRTOS” kernel is pre-integrated with Kinetis SDK and packed as a separate add-on ZIP package. It can be downloaded and unzipped directly to here without creating sub-folder.

The Percepio folder contains the FreeRTOS+Trace port.

NOTE:
The Utility.c and Utility.h are *not* part of FreeRTOS, but used in this port for safe string routines.
