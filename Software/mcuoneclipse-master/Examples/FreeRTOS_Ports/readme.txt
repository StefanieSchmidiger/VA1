==========
This folder contains 'static' ports of FreeRTOS.
The ports for FreeRTOS are generated by Processor Expert, 
but no Processor Expert is needed as the files are already generated, 
and the projects do not need Processor Expert.

The 'GenerateFreeRTOS' project is a CodeWarrior Processor Expert project which generates the files for all the different ports.
See the readme.txt inside that project for details.

Following ports are available:
- CodeWarrior:
  - FRDM-KL25Z board
  - FRDM-K20D50M board
- IAR:
  - FRDM-KL25Z board
  

To change the RTOS, adopt the FreeRTOSconfig.h header file.

Note that this folder is provided for older FreeRTOS ports.
The latest and greates version is maintained in a dedicated GitHub repository:
