----------
This is a Kinetis Design Studio V3.2.0 project for the NXP TWR-KV85F220M board.
It includes FreeRTOS V9.0.0 enabled for Segger RTT with Percepio Trace.

Several files of this projects are generated with Processor Expert McuOnEclipse components:
- FreeRTOS folder with V9.0.0
- McuOnEclipse folder with Segger RTT, Percepio trace and other utilities

This project contains the generated sources, so you do not need Processor Expert.
The project 'TWR_KV56F220M_PEx_2_SDKv2' on the same level as this project is used to generate the sources,
but the files are copied into this project to have it standalone.
