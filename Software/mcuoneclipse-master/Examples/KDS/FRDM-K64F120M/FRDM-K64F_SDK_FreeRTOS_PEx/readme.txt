This project uses the Kinetis SDK V1.0.0 with Processor Expert and Kinetis Design Studio V1.1.1.
The Kinetis SDK needs to be installed in its default location
C:\Freescale\KSDK_1.0.0
and the KSDK_PATH environment variable needs to point to the above folder.

In Application.c you can use USE_SDK_RTOS to switch between the SDK OSA (OS Abstraction) API or using
the FreeRTOS API.
