	abstract = {Information security, sometimes shortened to {InfoSec}, is the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. It is a general term that can be used regardless of the form the data may take (e.g. electronic, physical). The chief area of concern for the field of information security is the balanced protection of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data, also known as the {CIA} Triad, while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation and no major hampering of organization productivity. To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate and seek to set basic guidelines and policies on password, antivirus software, firewall, encryption software, legal liability and user/administrator training standards.},
