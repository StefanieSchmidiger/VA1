\section*{Changes on hardware}
For a new hardware, the following features had to be considered and evaluated for a possible implementation:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Interface for hardware debugging, e.g. SWD \\
	\item Dynamic switching between RS232 and TTL possible, e.g. by changing a jumper position \\
	\item Evaluate use of hardware flow control on interface between new hardware and modem. \\
		  Does it solve the problem of package losses or does it only move the problem to the Teensy side? \\
	\item 3.3V output for powering of connecting devices \\
\end{itemize}
