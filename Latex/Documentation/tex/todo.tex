\section*{To do list / Reminder}
Those things need to be done:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Target definition} \\
	What is the main outcome of VM1? Define it as exactly as possible. Graph, matrix, flow chart?
	\item \textbf{Approach documentation} \\
	Document (also with easy graphics) what the approach is and how we want to work. Interfaces between tracks?
	\item \textbf{Time planing} \\
	Refine the time table and plan accordingly. Where are the interfaces? FFT in tensorflow depends on research. 
	\item \textbf{Papers to follow} \\
	Follow 3 and 4, especially the people.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Reminders and informations}
Points to note:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Main focus} \\
	Tool chain is not relevant. It's about what is possible and not how exactly can that be done. For details see target definition.
	\item \textbf{FFT} \\
	Elia VM2 is reference, he also has a MATLAB model which may be useful.
	\item \textbf{Sobol} \\
	Possible use case is truck detection / count of truck axles.
\end{itemize}
